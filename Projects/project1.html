      <h2>✨Occupancy Detection – Internship✨</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship, I contributed to the development of a <strong>smart occupancy detection system
        </strong> using a combination of <strong>Passive Infrared (PIR)</strong> and <strong>Time-of-Flight (ToF)
        </strong> sensors. The objective of the project was to accurately detect human presence and occupancy 
        within a defined area to optimize energy usage and environmental control systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        My role in the project involved hands-on <strong>circuit design</strong>, where I wired and 
        integrated PIR and ToF sensors to create a reliable detection setup. I also used <strong>embedded 
            C</strong> to program the microcontroller logic, ensuring the system could process input from 
            both types of sensors to make smart occupancy decisions in real-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the technical implementation, I worked with <strong>CAD software</strong> to design 
        and 3D-print a protective housing for the system. This casing ensured the sensors were mounted 
        securely and operated efficiently in varied environments. The design process emphasized both 
        functionality and aesthetic integration into modern indoor spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system featured a <strong>Python-based server</strong> hosted on a Raspberry Pi, which 
        collected and transmitted sensor data remotely. This data was then pushed to a dynamic <strong>
        Node.js frontend</strong>, providing a live visualization of occupancy status. This full-stack 
        pipeline facilitated remote monitoring and data logging, offering real-world insights into space
        utilization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this internship experience deepened my understanding of <strong>IoT system development
        </strong>, <strong>embedded systems</strong>, <strong>hardware-software integration</strong>, and 
        <strong>real-time web communication</strong>. It provided a strong foundation in designing intelligent 
        environments using practical sensor technologies and cloud-connected architectures.
