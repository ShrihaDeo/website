            This interactive <strong>card game</strong> is inspired by the <strong>Flamme Rouge</strong> board game. It was developed in <strong>C#</strong> as part of a first-year project, focusing on strategic gameplay and player engagement. The project included the following key components:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Mechanics Design:</strong> Designed engaging game mechanics to ensure strategic gameplay and player involvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio:</strong> Utilized Visual Studio for coding, testing, and debugging, which helped streamline the development process.</li>
            <li><strong>Player Interaction:</strong> Focused on improving user interactions to enhance the overall gameplay experience.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Key programming concepts applied in this project included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> Used OOP principles to structure the game and its components efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Implemented event-driven programming to handle user inputs and game interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface Design:</strong> Developed a user-friendly interface to improve gameplay experience.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Through this project, I improved my <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>, <strong>logical thinking</strong>, and <strong>coding abilities</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In addition to technical skills, this experience gave me a better understanding of <strong>game development</strong>, <strong>software design</strong>, and <strong>interactive application creation</strong>. It was a valuable learning opportunity that strengthened my passion for building engaging and well-structured digital experiences.
